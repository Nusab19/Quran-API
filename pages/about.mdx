# About

Quran API is a REST API that provides verses, chapters, and recitations of the Quran.
Unlike other APIs, it has no rate limit. The API will stay free forever.

The API is built and maintained by [Nusab Taha](https://nusab19.pages.dev).
Special thanks to [AH Nayef](https://github.com/ahnayef) for his contribution.

## Note

Check out the [Quran Bot](https://t.me/AlFurqanRobot) in Telegram. It is the first full featured bot providing the Quran in various formats.
